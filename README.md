# Assignment 10
## Guitar Tutor
For this assignment I made a website for a individual guitar teacher who teaches through online video call lessons.

## [Live site](https://guitar-tutor-assignment.web.app/)

The main page is divided into 3 sections,
1. Banner
2. Services
3. Customer Reviews

The navbar will take you to the other pages like blogs, about and most importantly the **Login/Register** page. 

Here are the main features of this project
* Its a single page web app
* Its responsive for pc, mobile and tablets
* It has a authentication system to login or register new users using firebase
* The users can either use email and password or they can use their google account to login
* Even if the user forgets the password, there is a way to recover it using password reset email
* The page is hosted in firebase

I have used the following technologies/frameworks to build this project.
1. React
2. React Tailwind
3. React Router
4. Firebase
5. React firebase hooks
6. React toastify
